# UFO

QB64PE program to maneuver a flying saucer over a side-scrolling rolling terrain.

Known to work on a Windows 11 platform.

Requires QB64 Phoenix Edition 4.2.0.  Probably 4.0.0 or higher will also work.

To control spaceship flight, use an attached controller.  The program may need editing (lines 108-110, in Sub moveShip), if the controller isn't seen as controller #3, with axis 1 reporting horizontal movement, and axis 2 vertical.
